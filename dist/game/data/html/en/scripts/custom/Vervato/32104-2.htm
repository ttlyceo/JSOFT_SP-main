<body>Vervato:<br>
Hey, do you have money or not? Did you expect me to resurrect you without paying?<br>
Keep bothering me like this, and you'll have more trouble than you know what to do with!<br><br>
I have magic that can send this corpse so far from the chasm of death that it will never be revived!<br>
